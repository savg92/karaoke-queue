# RBAC Dashboard Placement Recommendations

> **Summary Recommendation:**
>
> For best security, auditability, and admin UX, implement a dedicated admin dashboard route (Option 1 below). This ensures global visibility for role monitoring and admin tools, and prevents admin features from being buried in event-specific or hard-to-find UI locations.

## **Current Issues with Bottom Placement:**

- Admins must scroll through all event content to reach admin tools
- Role monitoring data is global but placed in event-specific context
- Important security information is buried and easy to miss
- Creates inconsistent UX for administrative functions

## **Recommended Placement Options:**

### **Option 1: Dedicated Admin Section (**_Preferred_**)**

Create a separate admin dashboard accessible via navigation:

- Route: `/dashboard/admin` or `/admin`
- Global role monitoring across all events
- Centralized user management
- System-wide analytics
- Security violation alerts
- **Recommended for: auditability, security, and scalable admin UX**

### **Option 2: Sidebar/Panel Integration**

- Collapsible admin panel in dashboard layout
- Persistent access while viewing events
- Context-aware admin tools
- Quick access without navigation

### **Option 3: Top-level Admin Tab**

- Tab-based interface in event dashboard
- "Event" tab for karaoke management
- "Admin" tab for role monitoring
- Clean separation of concerns

### **Option 4: Header Admin Dropdown**

- Admin menu in top navigation
- Quick access to role monitoring
- Global scope (not event-specific)
- Consistent with admin UX patterns

## **Immediate Improvement:**

Move to a more prominent position within current structure:

- After EventHeader but before EventStats
- Clear visual separation with admin-specific styling
- Expandable/collapsible section

---

**Action:**

- Prioritize Option 1 for implementation in the next sprint.
- If not feasible immediately, apply the "Immediate Improvement" as a stopgap.
