---

## Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation (Initial Setup)

**Goal:** Establish a clean, modern, and type-safe foundation for the project.

  - [x] Role-based performance metrics and analytics[x] **Clean up boilerplate:**
    - [x] Remove default styles from `globals.css`.
    - [x] Clear the content of `page.tsx`.
- [x] **Install Core Dependencies:**
  - [x] Install `shadcn/ui`: `bunx shadcn-ui@latest init`.
  - [x] Install Prisma: `bun add prisma --dev`.
  - [x] Install Supabase helpers: `bun add @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs @supabase/ssr`.
  - [x] Install React Query: `bun add @tanstack/react-query`.
  - [x] Install Zod and React Hook Form: `bun add zod react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers`.
  - [x] Install Testing Libraries: `bun add vitest @vitest/ui @playwright/test --dev`.
  - [x] Setup Playwright: `bunx playwright install`.
- [x] **Set up Supabase Project:**
  - [x] Create a new project on the Supabase dashboard.
  - [x] Securely save the Project URL, `anon` key, and database connection strings.
- [x] **Configure Environment Variables:**
  - [x] Create a `.env.local` file in the project root.
  - [x] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
  - [x] Add `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, and `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`.
- [x] **Initialize Git Repository:**
  - [x] Run `git init`.
  - [x] Create a `.gitignore` file (Next.js provides a good default).
  - [x] Create `README.md`, `plan.md`, and `.github/copilot-instruction.md`.
  - [x] Make the initial commit: `feat: initial project setup and configuration`.
  - [x] Create a new repository on GitHub and push the initial commit.

---

## Phase 1: Database & Type Safety

**Goal:** Define a robust data layer with a clear schema, connect it to the database, and ensure type safety across the application.

- [x] **Integrate Prisma:**
  - [x] Initialize Prisma: `bunx prisma init`.
  - [x] Configure `schema.prisma` with the `postgresql` provider.
- [x] **Define Prisma Schema (`schema.prisma`):**
  - [x] Copy the defined schemas for `Profile`, `Event`, and `Signup`.
  - [x] Define the `PerformanceType` and `SignupStatus` enums.
  - [x] Verify all relations and indexes are correctly defined.
- [x] **Connect Prisma to Supabase:**
  - [x] Get the database connection pool URL from the Supabase dashboard.
  - [x] Add `DATABASE_URL` (for connection pooling) and `DIRECT_URL` (for migrations) to `.env.local`.
- [x] **Run Initial Migration & Generate Client:**
  - [x] Push the schema to the database: `bunx prisma migrate dev`.
  - [x] Verify that the tables (`Profile`, `Event`, `Signup`) have been created in the Supabase Table Editor.
  - [x] Generate the Prisma Client: `bunx prisma generate`.
- [x] **Create Prisma Client Instance:**
  - [x] Create a file at `src/lib/prisma.ts` to export a singleton Prisma Client instance, ensuring it's not re-initialized in development.
- [x] **Create Seed Script (Optional but Recommended):**
  - [x] Create a `prisma/seed.ts` file to populate the database with development data (e.g., a sample host and event).

---

## Phase 2: Security & Authentication

**Goal:** Implement a secure authentication system and enforce strict data access policies using RLS.

- [x] **Set Up Supabase Row Level Security (RLS):**
  - [x] In the Supabase SQL Editor, enable RLS on the `Profile`, `Event`, and `Signup` tables.
  - [x] **Define and run SQL policies:**
    - `Profiles`: Users can only view/edit their own profile.
    - `Events`: Hosts can only view/manage their own events. Public can read event details (name, slug).
    - `Signups`: Hosts can manage signups for their events. Authenticated users can create signups. Public access is denied.
- [x] **Integrate Supabase Auth Helper:**
  - [x] Create a `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` to export a client-side Supabase client.
  - [x] Create a `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` to export server-side clients.
  - [x] Create a `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` to export a middleware client.
  - [x] Set up the middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) to manage user sessions and refresh tokens.
- [x] **Implement Host Login Flow:**
  - [x] Create a route group `(auth)` with a `/login` page.
  - [x] Build a simple login form using `shadcn/ui` components.
  - [x] Create a Server Action to handle magic link sign-in using the Supabase client.
- [x] **Create Protected Routes & User Context:**
  - [x] Create a `/dashboard` route.
  - [x] Use the middleware to protect all routes under `/dashboard`, redirecting unauthenticated users to `/login`.
  - [x] Create a `useUser` hook to easily access the authenticated user's data in client components.

---

## Phase 3: Core Application Features

**Goal:** Build the primary features of the application: the public sign-up form and the host's management dashboard.

- [x] **Build Attendee Sign-up Form (`/event/[eventSlug]`):**
  - [x] Create the page at `src/app/event/[eventSlug]/page.tsx`.
  - [x] **Component Breakdown:**
    - [x] `SignupForm.tsx`: The main form component.
    - [x] `Zod Schema`: Define a schema in `src/lib/validators/signup.ts` for `singerName`, `songTitle`, `artist`, etc.
  - [x] Use `React Hook Form` with the Zod resolver for robust client-side validation.
  - [x] Use `shadcn/ui` (`Card`, `Input`, `Select`, `Button`) to build an intuitive form.
- [x] **Create New Signup Server Action:**
  - [x] Create the action at `src/app/actions/add-singer.ts`.
  - [x] **Implement "Fairness Algorithm"** in `src/lib/queue-logic.ts`. This pure function should take the current queue and determine the optimal `queuePosition` for a new singer.
  - [x] The action must:
    1.  [x] Validate input with the Zod schema.
    2.  [x] Use Prisma to fetch the current queue for the event.
    3.  [x] Call the fairness algorithm to get the new position.
    4.  [x] Create the new `Signup` record.
    5.  [x] Call `revalidatePath('/dashboard/[eventSlug]')` to clear the cache.
- [x] **Build Host Dashboard UI (`/dashboard/[eventSlug]`):**
  - [x] Create the page at `src/app/(dashboard)/[eventSlug]/page.tsx`.
  - [x] **Component Breakdown:**
    - [x] `QueueTable.tsx`: A `shadcn/ui` `<Table>` to display the list of signups.
    - [x] `QueueControls.tsx`: Buttons for managing the queue.
  - [x] Create a Server Action to fetch the queue data for the event, ordered by `queuePosition`.
  - [x] Use React Query's `useQuery` to call this action and display the data, providing server-state management.

---

## Phase 4: Real-time & Advanced Functionality

**Goal:** Enhance the host dashboard with real-time updates, management controls, and helpful integrations.

- [x] **Implement Real-time Updates:**
  - [x] Create a `useQueueSubscription` custom hook in `src/app/(dashboard)/[eventSlug]/hooks/useRealtimeQueue.ts`.
  - [x] The hook should use the client-side Supabase client to subscribe to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` events on the `signups` table for the current event.
  - [x] On receiving a new event, call `queryClient.invalidateQueries` with the queue's query key to trigger a re-fetch.
  - [x] Apply the hook to the Host Dashboard page.
- [x] **Build Queue Management Controls:**
  - [x] Add "Mark as Singing," "Mark as Done," and "Remove" buttons to the `QueueTable.tsx`.
  - [x] Create new Server Actions (`updateSignupStatus.ts`, `removeSignup.ts`) that use Prisma to modify signups.
  - [x] Use React Query's `useMutation` to call these actions from the UI, handling loading states and providing optimistic updates for a seamless UX.
- [x] **Integrate YouTube API:**
  - [x] Get a YouTube Data API v3 key from the Google Cloud Console and add it to `.env.local`.
  - [x] Create a Next.js Route Handler at `/app/api/youtube-search/route.ts`.
    - [x] The route accepts `songTitle` and `artist` as query parameters.
    - [x] It constructs a search query in the format: `"[Song Title]" "[Artist]" karaoke`.
    - [x] It uses the YouTube Data API to fetch the top 3-5 search results with fallback mock data.
  - [x] **Component Breakdown:**
    - [x] `YouTubeSearch.tsx`: A general component for manual YouTube searches.
    - [x] `YouTubeCard.tsx`: A component to display a single YouTube result with thumbnail, title, channel info, and action buttons (Watch/Select).
    - [x] `AutoYouTubeSearch.tsx`: Specialized component for automatic search that displays 3-5 results.
  - [x] On the dashboard, when a singer is "up next" (i.e., next in line with QUEUED status and position 1), the `AutoYouTubeSearch` component is rendered, automatically triggering the search and displaying the top 3-5 results with video thumbnails, titles, and links for the host to choose from.
- [x] **Implement QR Code Generation:**
  - [x] Install `qrcode.react`: `bun add qrcode.react`.
  - [x] Add a button on the dashboard that opens a `shadcn/ui` `<Dialog>`.
  - [x] Inside the dialog, display the QR code component, passing it the full public URL of the attendee sign-up page.
